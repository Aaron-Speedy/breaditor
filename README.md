# KIC
KIC is an experimental modal editor for fun.

Note(1): This is work in progress software. Use at your own risk! \
Note(2): This is currently going through a major private
rewrite. The current codebase will likely not last.

## Overview
KIC is a modal editor designed to implement various
experimental features. Some examples of features we have
or plan to have are:
- Multi-file buffers
- Display locks (for code folding, stick headers, etc.)
- Contextual hooks and regex

Documentation is coming soon. In the meantime, check out
the code for a look into the current system.

## Getting started (POSIX)
```sh
./build.sh
./kic FILE_NAME
